This project requires the openSSL libraries and Crypt32.lib.
For openSSL, watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMHEoBkxYaQ and follow very carefully.  It is long, but each step is important.

For Crypt32.lib - at the end of the video, when you are adding libcrypto.lib and libssl.lib to the linker, also add Crypt32.lib.  No path is needed.
